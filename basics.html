    <h1> Interneting Is Easy!  </h1>
    <p> First, we need to learn some basic HTML. </p>
    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of
    headings.</p>

    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or
    phrase.<strong>strong</strong></p>

    <ol>
      <li>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</li>
      <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
      <li><p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of
      headings.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>

    <p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>
